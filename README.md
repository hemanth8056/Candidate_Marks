## Question to be answered from this map reduce
Find out the average marks of one of the course Physics based on online application number

## Summary of the results
* The following scattered graph shows the marks in physics of all applications

![Marks obtained by students in physics](marks.png)

    By seeing the graph , we can predict the following results:
    - In the graph we can see that one of the candidate got highest marks 500 among other students.
    - second highest scorer close to 300 points.
    - remaining candidates got same average points.
    
*   The following  graph shows the top 10 average marks in physics by application numbers.

 From the above agraph we can see that top physics marks obtaind students with different application numbers.
